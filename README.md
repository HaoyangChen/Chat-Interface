## Chat Interface
This is a small project that I built in my free time to explore what it is like to create a responsive chat interface. This chat interface used Gulp based development environment with a watch task and was build using SASS. This chat interface supports both desktop and mobile environment. You can visit the live site by clicking [here](https://haoyangchen.github.io/Chat-Interface/) or copy this link https://haoyangchen.github.io/Chat-Interface/ and open it in a browser. 

#### Usage
Run 'Gulp' after installing all dependencies to live view on your local machine.
